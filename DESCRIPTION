Description: Functions for optimizing spectral band combinations for calculating
    the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), whcih is widely used in
    remote sensing studies for vegetation monitoring from space, and in precision
    agriculture for non-destructively estimation of plant growth status. The optimal
    bands for NDVI are determined by comparing the correlations between vegetative
    parameter and any possible two bands within the full spectrum.
