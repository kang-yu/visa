Title: Vegetation Imaging Spectroscopy Analyzer
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Kang", "Yu", email = "kang.yu@outlook.com",

Description: Provides easy-to-use tools for data analysis and visualization for hyperspectral remote sensing (also known as imaging spectroscopy), with 
    a particular focus on vegetation hyperspectral data analysis. It consists of a set of functions, ranging from the organization of hyperspectral data 
    in the proper data structure for spectral feature selection, calculation of vegetation index, multivariate analysis, as well as to the visualization 
    of spectra and results of analysis in the 'ggplot2' style.
