Title: Vegetation Imaging Spectroscopy Analyzer
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kang Yu
Maintainer: Kang Yu <kkaannggyu@gmail.com>
Description: Provides easy-to-use tools for data analysis and visualization in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing (also known as Imaging Spectroscopy), with 
    a particular focus on vegetation hyperspectral data analysis. It consists of a set of functions, ranging from the orgnization of hyperspectral data 
    in proper data structure for spectral feature selection, calculation of vegetation indices, multivariate analysis, as well as the visualization of 
    spectra and results of data analyis in the ggplot style.
