\title{Selecting the best 2-Band combinations for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)}
\usage{
ndvi(x, y, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of spectral data, a row is a spectrum across all spectral bands.}

\item{y}{A vector.}

\item{w}{A vector of wavelength.}
}
\value{
NDVI = (b1 - b2)/(b1 + b2)
}
\description{
This function developes a optimization algorithm based on correlation analysis between spectral parameter 'X' and y, which
determines the best spectral bands of the full spectrum that are most predictive for 'y'.
}
\details{
This function runs, throughly, a calculation of NDVI = (Xi-Xj)/(Xi+Xj) using all the possible pairs/combinations of any two bands (Xi,Xj)
within the full spectrum range. A correlation analysis is then performed between the y and all possible NDVIs (Xi,Xj), and it calculates
the correlation coefficients (r) which indicates the predictive performance of each NDVI and its corresponding two-band combination. The
output is the wavelength (nm) indicating the best two bands that produce the highest value of r.
