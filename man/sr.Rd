\title{Calculate Simple Ratio (SR).}
\usage{
sr(s, b1, b2)

nsr(s, b1, b2)

lm.sr(s, b1, b2, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Spectral data in the format of visa's Spectra object, spectra.data.frame or spectra.matrix.}

\item{b1}{A integer number which defines the wavelength of the 1st spectral band.}

\item{b2}{A integer number which defines the wavelength of the 2nd spectral band.}

\item{y}{A numeric variable to correlate with SR}
}
\description{
Simple Ratio is the ratio of the spectra (mostly reflectance) between two bands
in the format of \deqn{SR = \lambda_i/\lambda_j}

It is a normalization of SR by doing NSR = (1-SR)/(1+SR), with the same two spectral bands.
}
\details{
Simple ratio and NDVI looking indices are the two groups of mostly used spectral indices in remote sensing.

As it exactly reads in its name, it is a normalization of the SR and ranges in (0,1).
